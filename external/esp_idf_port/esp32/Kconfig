        Because the external/internal RAM allocation strategy is not always perfect, it sometimes may happen

        If the number of universal MAC addresses is four, all four interfaces (WiFi station, WiFi softap,
        Bluetooth and Ethernet) receive a universally administered MAC address. These are generated
        sequentially by adding 0, 1, 2 and 3 (respectively) to the final octet of the base MAC address.

        and 1 (respectively) to the base MAC address. The remaining two interfaces (WiFi softap and Ethernet)

        re-detect more root nodes. This process will repeat until all root node conflicts are resolved. However this process
        can generally take a very long time.

        To counter this situation, the beacon frame length can be increased such that more root nodes can be detected simultaneously.
        Each additional root node will require 36 bytes and should be added ontop of the default beacon frame length of
        752 bytes. For example, if you want to detect 10 root nodes simultaneously, you need to set the beacon frame length as
        932 (752+36*5).

        Setting a longer beacon length also assists with debugging as the conflicting root nodes can be identified more quickly.

    help
        If this option is enabled, NVS will be initialized and calibration data will be loaded from there.
        PHY calibration will be skipped on deep sleep wakeup. If calibration data is not found, full calibration
        will be performed and stored in NVS. Normally, only partial calibration will be performed.
        If this option is disabled, full calibration will be performed.

        If it's easy that your board calibrate bad data, choose 'n'.
        Two cases for example, you should choose 'n':
        1.If your board is easy to be booted up with antenna disconnected.
        2.Because of your board design, each time when you do calibration, the result are too unstable.
        If unsure, choose 'y'.

        partition is included (type: 'data', subtype: 'phy').
        With default partition tables, this is done automatically.
        If PHY init data is stored in a partition, it has to be flashed there,
        otherwise runtime error will occur.

        If this option is not enabled, PHY init data will be embedded
        into the application binary.

        If unsure, choose 'n'.

config PM_ENABLE
	bool "Support for power management"
	default n
	help
		If enabled, application is compiled with support for power management.
		This option has run-time overhead (increased interrupt latency,
		longer time to enter idle state), and it also reduces accuracy of
		RTOS ticks and timers used for timekeeping.
		Enable this option if application uses power management APIs.

config PM_DFS_INIT_AUTO
	bool "Enable dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) at startup"
	depends on PM_ENABLE
	default n
	help
		If enabled, startup code configures dynamic frequency scaling.
		Max CPU frequency is set to CONFIG_ESP32_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ setting,
		min frequency is set to XTAL frequency.
		If disabled, DFS will not be active until the application
		configures it using esp_pm_configure function.

config PM_USE_RTC_TIMER_REF
	bool "Use RTC timer to prevent time drift (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PM_ENABLE && (ESP32_TIME_SYSCALL_USE_RTC || ESP32_TIME_SYSCALL_USE_RTC_FRC1)
	default n
	help
		When APB clock frequency changes, high-resolution timer (esp_timer)
		scale and base value need to be adjusted. Each adjustment may cause
		small error, and over time such small errors may cause time drift.
		If this option is enabled, RTC timer will be used as a reference to
		compensate for the drift.
		It is recommended that this option is only used if 32k XTAL is selected
		as RTC clock source.

config PM_PROFILING
	bool "Enable profiling counters for PM locks"
	depends on PM_ENABLE
	default n
	help
		If enabled, esp_pm_* functions will keep track of the amount of time
		each of the power management locks has been held, and esp_pm_dump_locks
		function will print this information.
		This feature can be used to analyze which locks are preventing the chip
		from going into a lower power state, and see what time the chip spends
		in each power saving mode. This feature does incur some run-time
		overhead, so should typically be disabled in production builds.

config PM_TRACE
	bool "Enable debug tracing of PM using GPIOs"
	depends on PM_ENABLE
	default n
	help
		If enabled, some GPIOs will be used to signal events such as RTOS ticks,
		frequency switching, entry/exit from idle state. Refer to pm_trace.c
		file for the list of GPIOs.
		This feature is intended to be used when analyzing/debugging behavior
		of power management implementation, and should be kept disabled in
		applications.
